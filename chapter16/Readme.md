### Interfaces & Methods in details
- Let consumers define interfaces
- Re-use standard interfaces wherever possible
- Keep interface declarations small
- Compose one method interfaces into larger interfaces
- Avoid coupling interfaces to particular types/implementations
- Accept interfaces, but return concrete types

Be liberal in what you accept, be conservative in what you return

The interface{} type has no methods, so it is satisfied by anything
