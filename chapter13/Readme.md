### Go does OOP?

Go offers four main supports for OOP:
- Encapsulation using the package for visibility control
- abstraction & polymorphism using interface types
- enhanced composition to provide structure sharing

Go does not offer inheritance or substitutability based on types.

Not having classes can be liberating!

Go allows defining methods on any user defined type, rather than only a class.
